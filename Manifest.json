  "description": "Currently I am holding on development due to a data sheet bug that is keeping this mod from working properly, i.e. enemy ships spawning in friendly ports (Brest, la Rochelle), Ships spawning too close to Uboat, and incorrect convoy / shipping activity. Hopefully this will be corrected soon so I can continue development. If anyone finds solutions to these issues. please let me know./r/n/r/nWIP: EXPECT BUGS AND UNINTENDED BEHAVIOR \r\nAdds an extensive list of convoys and merchant vessel shipping lanes.
