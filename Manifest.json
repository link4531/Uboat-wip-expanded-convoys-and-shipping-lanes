  "description": "Great News! Expand Convoys and Shipping Lanes is back, a major bug was removed which allows for this mod to contine development to its full potential. \r\nThis Mod only works with 126P13 and after due to the dev team fixing bugs that kept this mod from working \r\n\r\nWIP: EXPECT BUGS AND UNINTENDED BEHAVIOR \r\n Version:0.4 brings back many of the original convoys and shipping lanes that were broken, Port ownership changes now properly work with Uboat version 126P12+  \r\nAdds an extensive list of convoys and merchant vessel shipping lanes. Currently I am only looking for feedback, or potential contributors to this mod. \r\n\r\n This mod requires the following mods: \r\nExpanded Ports Mod (shipping lanes an convoys incorporate ports not currently in base game) \r\n Saint-Nazaire Port mod (Required by Expanded Ports mod) \r\nMore Diverse Ship names (Due to additional country ports and shipping vessels, additional ship names are provided by this mod) \r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\nAdded Reserve Naval forces in Ports owned by Germany and other ports, which was missing. \r\nAdded Merchant Shipping lanes in North and South America (Complete)\r\nAdded Trans Atlantic Shipping lanes (Mostly Complete)\r\nAdded German Supply routes (Partially Complete)\r\n Additional Convoys (incomplete) \r\n activity periods for Shipping lanes and Convoys (on hold due to bug)\r\nFighter Aircraft (partially working)\r\nA large number of additional country shipping vessels have been added, however they are currently missing Flag assets.Someone please Develop a flag mod :-)",
