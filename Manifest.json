  "description": "Great News! Expand Convoys and Shipping Lanes is back, a major bug was removed which allows for this mod to contine development to its full potential. \r\nThis Mod only works with 126P13 and after due recent updates allowing this mod to work. \r\n\r\nWIP: EXPECT BUGS AND UNINTENDED BEHAVIOR \r\n Version:0.4 brings back many of the original convoys and shipping lanes that were broken, Port ownership changes now properly work with Uboat version 126P12+  \r\nAdds an extensive list of convoys and merchant vessel shipping lanes.
